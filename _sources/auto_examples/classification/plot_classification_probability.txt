Plot classification probability
===============================

Plot the classification probability for different classifiers. We use a 3
class dataset, and we classify it with a Support Vector classifier, L1
and L2 penalized logistic regression with either a One-Vs-Rest or multinomial
setting.

The logistic regression is not a multiclass classifier out of the box. As
a result it can identify only the first class.
